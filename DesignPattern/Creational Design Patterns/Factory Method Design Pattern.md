Sure! Let’s break down the **Factory Method Design Pattern** with a **real-time example from the payment industry**, using **Java**. We’ll go from **beginner-level understanding to advanced implementation**, with code examples and clear explanations at each step.

---

## 🏗️ What is the Factory Method Design Pattern?

> The **Factory Method Pattern** is a **creational design pattern** that provides an interface for creating objects, but allows **subclasses** to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### ✅ Key Benefits:

* Loose coupling
* Flexibility in object creation
* Follows **Open/Closed Principle** (easy to extend without modifying code)

---

## 🏦 Real-Time Example: Payment Gateway

Let’s imagine you’re building a system that supports **multiple payment methods**, such as:

* Credit Card
* PayPal
* UPI

Instead of hardcoding which payment class to use, you can use the **Factory Method** to create the right one **dynamically**.

## 🪜 Step-by-Step: Beginner to Advanced

---

### 🔰 Beginner: Without Factory Pattern

```java
public class PaymentService {
    public void pay(String method) {
        if (method.equals("CREDIT_CARD")) {
            System.out.println("Paid using Credit Card.");
        } else if (method.equals("PAYPAL")) {
            System.out.println("Paid using PayPal.");
        } else if (method.equals("UPI")) {
            System.out.println("Paid using UPI.");
        }
    }
}
```

**❌ Problems:**

* Hardcoded logic
* Violates Open/Closed Principle
* Not scalable

---

### ✅ Apply Factory Method Pattern

---

### 1. **Step 1: Create a Common Interface**

```java
public interface Payment {
    void pay(double amount);
}
```

---

### 2. **Step 2: Concrete Implementations**

```java
public class CreditCardPayment implements Payment {
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid ₹" + amount + " using Credit Card.");
    }
}

public class PaypalPayment implements Payment {
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid ₹" + amount + " using PayPal.");
    }
}

public class UpiPayment implements Payment {
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid ₹" + amount + " using UPI.");
    }
}
```

---

### 3. **Step 3: Create a Factory Class**

```java
public abstract class PaymentFactory {
    public abstract Payment createPayment();
}
```

---

### 4. **Step 4: Concrete Factories**

```java
public class CreditCardPaymentFactory extends PaymentFactory {
    public Payment createPayment() {
        return new CreditCardPayment();
    }
}

public class PaypalPaymentFactory extends PaymentFactory {
    public Payment createPayment() {
        return new PaypalPayment();
    }
}

public class UpiPaymentFactory extends PaymentFactory {
    public Payment createPayment() {
        return new UpiPayment();
    }
}
```

---

### 5. **Step 5: Use the Factory**

```java
public class PaymentClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PaymentFactory factory;

        factory = new CreditCardPaymentFactory();
        Payment payment1 = factory.createPayment();
        payment1.pay(1500.0);

        factory = new PaypalPaymentFactory();
        Payment payment2 = factory.createPayment();
        payment2.pay(999.0);

        factory = new UpiPaymentFactory();
        Payment payment3 = factory.createPayment();
        payment3.pay(250.0);
    }
}
```

---

### 🧠 Advanced: Dynamic Factory Using Enum or Registry

Instead of writing a new class for each payment type, use a **registry or enum-based dynamic factory**.

```java
public class DynamicPaymentFactory {
    public static Payment getPayment(String type) {
        return switch (type.toUpperCase()) {
            case "CREDIT_CARD" -> new CreditCardPayment();
            case "PAYPAL" -> new PaypalPayment();
            case "UPI" -> new UpiPayment();
            default -> throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid payment method");
        };
    }
}
```

**Usage:**

```java
public class PaymentClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Payment payment = DynamicPaymentFactory.getPayment("PAYPAL");
        payment.pay(1200.0);
    }
}
```

## ✅ Summary

| Level        | Approach                         | Strengths                   |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Beginner     | `if-else` or `switch` logic      | Simple, but not scalable    |
| Intermediate | Abstract Factory Classes         | Scalable, OOP-friendly      |
| Advanced     | Enum or Registry-based Factories | Flexible, easy to configure |

## 🧩 When to Use Factory Method in Payments

* Adding new payment methods frequently
* Supporting plugin-based or external payment providers
* Handling 3rd-party SDKs with different interfaces

Would you like this same pattern using **Spring Framework**, or in a **REST API** context? I can show that too.
