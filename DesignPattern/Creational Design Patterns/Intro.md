Creational Design Patterns
Creational Design Patterns focus on the process of object creation or problems related to object creation. They help in making a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. Creational patterns give a lot of flexibility in what gets created, who creates it, and how it gets created. There are two main themes in these patterns:

They keep information about the specific classes used in the system hidden.
They hide the details of how instances of these classes are created and assembled.

Sometimes creational patterns are competitors. For Example: there are cases when either Prototype or Abstract Factory could be used profitably. At other times they are complimentary: Builder can use one of the other patterns to implement which components get built. The Prototype can use Singleton in its implementation.
