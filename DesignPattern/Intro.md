# **Java Design Patterns Tutorial**

**Last Updated: 03 Jan, 2025**

**Design patterns in Java** refer to structured approaches involving objects and classes to solve recurring design issues in specific contexts. These patterns offer reusable, general solutions to common problems in software development and represent **established best practices**. By using design patterns, developers communicate more effectively and build **collaborative, consistent, and maintainable** codebases.

## **What are Design Patterns?**

A **design pattern** is a **reusable solution** to common software design problems. It is not a finished design or complete code but a **template or model** for solving specific problems in different contexts.

Design patterns provide flexibility, consistency, and a shared vocabulary among developers for better collaboration and maintainability.

## **Types of Software Design Patterns in Java**

Design patterns are generally categorized into three main types:

1. **Creational Patterns** – Concerned with object creation.
2. **Structural Patterns** – Focused on object composition.
3. **Behavioral Patterns** – Deal with communication between objects.

---

## **Creational Design Patterns in Java**

These patterns handle **object creation** mechanisms, trying to create objects in a way suitable to the situation. They abstract the instantiation process and help the system become independent of how objects are created.

### Types:

* **Factory Method Pattern**

  * Separates object creation from implementation.
  * Allows creating objects without specifying the exact class.

* **Abstract Factory Pattern**

  * A factory of factories.
  * Provides an interface to create families of related or dependent objects.

* **Singleton Pattern**

  * Ensures only one instance of a class is created.
  * Provides a global point of access to it.

* **Prototype Pattern**

  * Creates new objects by copying an existing object.
  * Useful for objects that are expensive to create.

* **Builder Pattern**

  * Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
  * Allows constructing different representations using the same process.

---

## **Structural Design Patterns in Java**

These patterns deal with **object composition**, creating relationships between objects to form larger structures while keeping them flexible and efficient.

### Types:

* **Adapter Pattern**

  * Converts one interface into another expected by the client.
  * Lets incompatible classes work together.

* **Bridge Pattern**

  * Separates abstraction from implementation.
  * Both can vary independently.

* **Composite Pattern**

  * Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly.
  * Represents part-whole hierarchies.

* **Decorator Pattern**

  * Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically.
  * More flexible than subclassing.

* **Facade Pattern**

  * Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
  * Improves usability.

* **Flyweight Pattern**

  * Reduces the cost of creating a large number of similar objects.
  * Shares objects instead of creating duplicates.

* **Proxy Pattern**

  * Provides a placeholder or surrogate to control access to another object.
  * Useful for lazy loading, access control, logging, etc.

---

## **Behavioral Design Patterns in Java**

These patterns focus on how **objects interact and communicate**, making the system easier to understand and extend.

### Types:

* **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**

  * Passes requests along a chain of handlers.
  * Each handler decides to process or pass on.

* **Command Pattern**

  * Encapsulates a request as an object.
  * Allows parameterizing clients, queuing requests, and logging operations.

* **Interpreter Pattern**

  * Provides a way to evaluate grammar or expressions.
  * Used for parsing languages.

* **Mediator Pattern**

  * Reduces coupling between classes by centralizing communication.
  * Objects interact through a mediator.

* **Memento Pattern**

  * Captures and restores an object's state.
  * Enables undo/redo mechanisms.

* **Observer Pattern**

  * Defines a one-to-many dependency.
  * When one object changes, all dependents are notified.

* **State Pattern**

  * Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

* **Strategy Pattern**

  * Defines a family of algorithms.
  * Makes them interchangeable and encapsulated.

* **Template Method Pattern**

  * Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, letting subclasses fill in steps.

* **Visitor Pattern**

  * Separates an algorithm from the objects on which it operates.
  * Useful for performing operations on object structures.

## **When to Use Design Patterns in Java**

Use design patterns when:

* Solving **common, repeatable** design problems.
* You want to **enhance reusability, flexibility, and maintainability**.
* Promoting **modularity, encapsulation, or separation of concerns**.
* Improving **team collaboration** through shared design vocabulary.
* Optimizing for **performance or resource management**.

---

## **When Not to Use Design Patterns in Java**

Avoid design patterns when:

* Solving **simple problems**—they may overcomplicate the solution.
* It leads to **premature optimization** or unnecessary abstraction.
* Your team lacks understanding, which can lead to misuse.
* You’re constrained by **time, resources, or skills**.
* Your system needs to **frequently adapt to changes**, and rigid patterns become bottlenecks.
