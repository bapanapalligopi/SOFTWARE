## **Cryptography and Its Types**

**Last Updated: 12 Jul, 2025**

Cryptography is a technique of securing information and communications using codes to ensure **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **authentication**. Thus, preventing unauthorized access to information. The prefix "crypt" means "hidden" and the suffix "graphy" means "writing". In cryptography, the techniques used to protect information are derived from **mathematical concepts** and a set of **rule-based calculations** known as **algorithms**. These algorithms are used for cryptographic **key generation**, **digital signing**, and **verification** to protect data privacy, web browsing on the internet, and confidential transactions such as **credit card** and **debit card** transactions.

### **Features of Cryptography**

The features of cryptography that make it a popular choice in various applications can be listed as:

1. **Confidentiality:** Information can only be accessed by the person for whom it is intended, and no one else can access it.
2. **Integrity:** Information cannot be modified during storage or transmission without detection.
3. **Non-repudiation:** The creator/sender of information cannot deny their intention to send it at a later stage.
4. **Authentication:** The identities of the sender and receiver are confirmed, and the origin/destination of the information is verified.
5. **Interoperability:** Cryptography allows for secure communication between different systems and platforms.
6. **Adaptability:** Cryptography evolves continuously to stay ahead of security threats and technological advancements.

### **How Does a Cryptographic Key Work?**

As we know, cryptography is used to convert **plaintext** into **ciphertext**. This technique is done using a **cryptographic key**. A cryptographic key is a string of characters that encrypts and decrypts the data.

For example:

* **Plaintext:** "Geeks for Geeks"
* **Ciphertext:** "HYMeAS90#"
* **Key:** ⚿

### **Types of Cryptography**

There are three main types of cryptography: **Symmetric Key Cryptography**, **Asymmetric Key Cryptography**, and **Hash Functions**. Below is a detailed explanation:

### 1. **Symmetric Key Cryptography**

In **Symmetric Key Cryptography**, both the sender and the receiver use a **single common key** to encrypt and decrypt messages. While this method is **faster** and **simpler**, the problem lies in the fact that the sender and receiver must securely exchange the key beforehand. The most popular symmetric key cryptographic systems are:

* **Data Encryption Standard (DES)**
* **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**

### 2. **Hash Functions**

In **Hash Function** cryptography, no key is required. Instead, mathematical equations are used to generate a hash message for any arbitrary length of message. The output will always be of a **fixed length**. Some of the famous hash functions are:

* **SHA-256**
* **MD5**
* **MD6**

### 3. **Asymmetric Key Cryptography**

In **Asymmetric Key Cryptography**, a **pair of keys** is used to encrypt and decrypt information. The **sender's public key** is used for encryption, and the **receiver's private key** is used for decryption. Public and private keys are different, and even if the public key is known to everyone, only the receiver can decode the message with their private key. The most popular asymmetric key cryptographic algorithm is:

* **RSA Algorithm**

### **Applications of Cryptography**

Cryptography has a broad range of applications in the modern world, where technology is rapidly evolving. From authentication measures to cryptocurrencies, cryptography plays a crucial role. Some of the most common applications include:

1. **Computer Passwords:** Cryptography is used in computer security to maintain and create passwords. Passwords are hashed and encrypted, ensuring even if a hacker gains access to the database, the passwords are unreadable.
2. **Digital Currencies:** Cryptography protects transactions and prevents fraud in digital currencies like **Bitcoin**. Complex algorithms and cryptographic keys safeguard transactions.
3. **Secure Web Browsing:** Cryptography protects online browsing from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. **SSL** and **TLS** protocols use public key cryptography to establish a secure communication channel.
4. **Electronic Signatures:** Digital signatures serve as the electronic equivalent of a handwritten signature. They are created using cryptography and verified through public key cryptography.
5. **Authentication:** Cryptography is used in various authentication protocols to confirm a user's identity and their access rights to resources.
6. **Cryptocurrencies:** Cryptocurrencies such as **Bitcoin** and **Ethereum** rely on cryptography to secure transactions, prevent fraud, and maintain the network’s integrity.
7. **End-to-End Internet Encryption:** End-to-end encryption protects two-way communications like video chats, instant messaging, and email. Only the intended recipient can read the message, ensuring high levels of privacy and security.

### **Types of Cryptography Algorithms**

Cryptographic algorithms can be classified based on how they use and manage keys, their efficiency, and their workflow. Some common cryptographic algorithms include:

1. **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES):** AES is a symmetric block cipher algorithm that uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. It operates with block sizes of **128 bits**, **192 bits**, or **256 bits** and is widely used as a replacement for the older **DES** algorithm.

2. **Data Encryption Standard (DES):** DES is an older encryption algorithm that converts **64-bit plaintext** into **48-bit encrypted ciphertext**. While outdated, it serves as a basic foundation for understanding newer encryption algorithms.

3. **RSA:** RSA is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that uses two different keys (public and private) for encryption. It works on the block cipher principle to convert plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa.

4. **Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA):** SHA generates **fixed-length digital fingerprints** (hashes) of input data to ensure **data integrity**. Variants like **SHA-2** and **SHA-3** are commonly used to ensure authenticity and integrity. Even the smallest change in input data drastically alters the hash, making it a good tool for verifying data integrity.

### **Advantages of Cryptography**

Cryptography has several remarkable features that make it widely adopted across the globe in different technologies. Some of these advantages include:

* **Access Control:** Cryptography ensures that only authorized individuals can access a resource.
* **Secure Online Communication:** Cryptography secures the transmission of sensitive information such as passwords, bank account numbers, and private data over the internet.
* **Protection Against Attacks:** Cryptography provides defenses against various types of attacks, including **man-in-the-middle** and **replay attacks**.
* **Compliance with Legal Requirements:** Cryptography helps organizations meet data protection and privacy legislation requirements.

### **Conclusion**

Cryptography is crucial in securing information and communications by converting data into coded formats to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. It is widely used in a variety of applications, including securing online transactions, web browsing, passwords, digital currencies, and authentication.

Cryptography continuously evolves to stay ahead of security threats, offering solutions such as **symmetric key encryption (AES)**, **asymmetric key encryption (RSA)**, and **hash functions (SHA)** to ensure data privacy and integrity.

With its widespread applications in fields like **secure web browsing**, **cryptocurrencies**, **electronic signatures**, and **end-to-end encryption**, cryptography plays a vital role in protecting sensitive data from malicious actors. As digital threats continue to rise, cryptography ensures that only authorized parties can access, modify, or transmit critical information securely.
