## **History of Cryptography**

**Last Updated: 11 Jul, 2025**

Humans have two basic needs when we talk about communication. One is the need to **communicate selectively**, to communicate and share information. These two basic needs while communicating gave rise to **coding** and **encrypting** the messages in such a way that only intended people could have access to the information.

The word **'cryptography'** originated from two Greek words: **'Krypto'** meaning hidden, and **'graphene'** meaning writing.

### **Classical Cryptography**

The roots of cryptography can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as the Romans and Egyptians. Below are some of the ancient types of cryptography:

---

### 1. **Hieroglyphs Cryptography**

The earliest known use of cryptography can be dated back to **1900 BCE**, during the time of the **Old Kingdom of Egypt**, in the form of non-standard **hieroglyphs**.

* **Hieroglyphs** were a secret form of communication that the Egyptians used to communicate with one another.
* This secret text was known only to the scribes of the kings who used to transmit messages on their behalf.

---

### 2. **Caesar Cipher**

The ancient Greeks were well known for the use of ciphers. The **Caesar Cipher** or **Shift Cipher** is one of the earliest and simplest cryptographic techniques.

* It is a form of **Substitution Cipher**, where each character in a word is replaced by a fixed number of positions.
* For example, with a shift of **3**, A is replaced by **D**, B by **E**, and so on.

**Caesar Cipher Example:**

* **Plaintext:** `HELLO`
* **Ciphertext (Shift 3):** `KHOOR`

### 3. **Vigenère Cipher**

During the **16th century**, **Vigenère** designed a cipher in which the encryption key is repeated multiple times across the entire message. The ciphertext is generated by adding the message character with the key character modulo 26.

* This approach is also **vulnerable to attacks**, where the secrecy of the message depends on the secrecy of the encryption key.

---

### 4. **Hebern Rotating Machine**

At the start of the **19th century**, **Hebern** designed a **Hebern rotating machine**.

* In this machine, a **single rotor** is used where the secret key is embedded in the rotating disc and the key has an embedded substitution table.
* Each key press from the keyboard resulted in the output of ciphertext.
* This code can be broken by using **letter frequencies**.

---

### 5. **Enigma Machine**

Cryptography played a **vital role** in the victory of the Allied forces during **World War I** and **World War II**. World War II prominently saw the use of **electromechanical cipher machines**. The story of the Allied victory over the Germans by cracking the world-famous **Enigma machine** is well-known.

* Like all rotor machines, Enigma is a combination of **electromechanical subsystems**.
* It consisted of **3 to 5 rotors**.
* Whenever a key was pressed, one or more rotors rotated on the spindle, and accordingly, the key was scrambled to something else.
* The **Enigma cipher** was eventually broken by Poland.

## **Data Encryption Standard (DES)**

In the early **1970s**, IBM realized that its customer base was requesting some type of encryption method to protect data. They formed a **crypto group** headed by **Horst-Feistel**. This group designed a cipher called **Lucifer**.

* In **1973**, the **National Bureau of Standards (NBS)** (now known as **NIST**) put out a proposal for a block cipher.
* **Lucifer** was eventually accepted and called **Data Encryption Standard (DES)**.
* It is a **symmetric-key** algorithm based on the **Feistel cipher** and is used for the encryption of electronic data.
* **DES** has a relatively small **key size** of **56 bits** and is encrypted **64 bits (8 characters)** at a time.
* In **1997**, DES was broken by an **exhaustive search attack**.
* Later, it was discontinued as it was found to be insecure, especially against **brute force attacks** due to its relatively small key size.

## **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**

In **1997**, NIST again put out a proposal for a new block cipher. The **Rijndael cipher** was eventually accepted and renamed as **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**.

* **AES** was introduced in **2001** as the replacement for **DES**.
* Unlike **DES**, **AES** is based on a **substitution-permutation network**.
* **AES** is a sub-set of **Rijndael** and is a family of ciphers with different key and block sizes.
* In the case of **AES**, the block size is **128 bits (16 characters)**, meaning 16 characters can be encrypted at a time.
* It comes with three different key size variants: **128 bits**, **192 bits**, and **256 bits**.
