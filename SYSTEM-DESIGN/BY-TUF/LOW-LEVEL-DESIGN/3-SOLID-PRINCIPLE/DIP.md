Here‚Äôs exactly what you gave ‚Äî formatted neatly for readability and easy reuse in notes, documentation, or study material:

## **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

### **Pre-requisites**

To better understand the DIP, it is recommended to have a basic understanding of the following terms:

* **High-Level Modules:** The parts of your code that contain the core logic ‚Äî the brains of your application. They make big decisions and coordinate how different features work together.
  **Example:** CEO (makes decisions, plans strategies).

* **Low-Level Modules:** The ones that handle the details ‚Äî like talking to a database, making API calls, reading files, or providing data. They support the high-level logic by doing the grunt work.
  **Example:** Employees (do the actual implementation, logistics, and execution).

* **Abstraction**

---

### **Introduction**

There is a set of five principles for writing clean, scalable, maintainable object-oriented code. These principles are known as **SOLID principles**.
The **D** in SOLID stands for **Dependency Inversion Principle**.

---

### **Definition**

> ‚ÄúHigh-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.‚Äù

In simpler words, rather than high-level classes controlling and depending on the details of lower-level ones, both should rely on **interfaces or abstract classes**. This makes your code flexible, testable, and easier to maintain.

---

### **Real-life Analogy**

Let's say you're hungry and you want pizza. You use a food delivery app, and not contact the chef directly.

**You (user)** ‚Üí Use ‚Üí **Food App (Abstraction)**
**Food App** ‚Üí Deals with ‚Üí **Restaurant/Chef (Implementation)**

---

### **Understanding**

You don't care which chef will make the pizza or how the pizza is made or who is your delivery partner ‚Äî you just want it delivered from your selected restaurant on time.

Here:

* You = High-level module
* Food App Interface = Abstraction
* Restaurant = Low-level module

You're not directly dependent on any specific details, but only on the food delivery system (abstraction).

This is what exactly DIP suggests while writing code with industry standards ‚Äî **high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Instead, both should depend on abstractions.**

---

### **Example: Netflix Recommendation Engine**

Netflix uses various recommendation strategies:

* **Recently Added:** Shows/movies recently added to the catalog
* **Trending Now:** Based on what's currently popular
* **Genre-Based:** What you've watched and liked before

Now let's see how Netflix might (badly) and should (correctly) implement this using the Dependency Inversion Principle.

---

#### **Without DIP ‚Äî Tightly Coupled Code**

*(Example code illustration in Cpp/Java/Python)*

Issues in the above code:

* `RecommendationEngine` is tightly coupled to `RecentlyAdded`.
* If we want to switch to `TrendingNow` or `GenreBased` strategies, we have to modify the engine.

---

#### **With DIP ‚Äî Using Abstraction**

*(Example code illustration in Cpp/Java/Python)*

Here:

* `RecommendationEngine` doesn‚Äôt care how recommendations are made ‚Äî it just needs a recommendation.
* The strategies (`TrendingNow`, `RecentlyAdded`, `GenreBased`) can be switched or upgraded anytime, without changing the engine.

---

### **Easier Switching between Strategies at Runtime**

Let‚Äôs say a user switches from ‚ÄúRecently Added‚Äù to ‚ÄúGenre-Based‚Äù dynamically.
*(Example code illustration in Cpp/Java/Python)*

No changes required in `RecommendationEngine` class ‚Äî just pass a new strategy.
That‚Äôs the power of the **Dependency Inversion Principle** used in designing the recommendation strategy.

---

### **Benefits of Using DIP**

* **Flexibility:** Easily swap out implementations without modifying high-level code.
* **Testability:** You can mock or stub the abstractions during testing.
* **Reusability:** Code becomes reusable since it‚Äôs not tightly bound to one specific implementation.
* **Maintainability:** Makes it easier to change one part of the system without affecting others.
* **Scalability:** You can scale or upgrade parts of your codebase without a massive rewrite.

Would you like me to add a **Java code example** for this (Netflix-style or a simpler abstraction example)?
Good catch üëç ‚Äî you‚Äôre right, the Java code examples weren‚Äôt included in that formatted version.
Here‚Äôs a full **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** explanation **with Java code examples**, including both the *bad (violating DIP)* and *good (following DIP)* approaches.

---

## **Without DIP ‚Äî Tightly Coupled Code**

```java
// Low-level module
class RecentlyAdded {
    public String getRecommendations() {
        return "Showing Recently Added Movies...";
    }
}

// High-level module (depends directly on low-level)
class RecommendationEngine {
    private RecentlyAdded recentlyAdded;

    public RecommendationEngine() {
        this.recentlyAdded = new RecentlyAdded();  // tightly coupled
    }

    public void showRecommendations() {
        System.out.println(recentlyAdded.getRecommendations());
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RecommendationEngine engine = new RecommendationEngine();
        engine.showRecommendations();
    }
}
```

### **Issues:**

* `RecommendationEngine` is directly tied to `RecentlyAdded`.
* To switch to a new recommendation type (e.g., `TrendingNow`), you must modify `RecommendationEngine`.
* Violates **Dependency Inversion Principle** ‚Äî high-level depends on low-level.

---

## **With DIP ‚Äî Using Abstraction**

```java
// Abstraction (Interface)
interface RecommendationService {
    String getRecommendations();
}

// Low-level modules implement the abstraction
class RecentlyAdded implements RecommendationService {
    public String getRecommendations() {
        return "Showing Recently Added Movies...";
    }
}

class TrendingNow implements RecommendationService {
    public String getRecommendations() {
        return "Showing Trending Now Movies...";
    }
}

class GenreBased implements RecommendationService {
    public String getRecommendations() {
        return "Showing Genre-Based Recommendations...";
    }
}

// High-level module depends on abstraction, not concrete classes
class RecommendationEngine {
    private RecommendationService recommendationService;

    // Constructor injection (dependency injection)
    public RecommendationEngine(RecommendationService recommendationService) {
        this.recommendationService = recommendationService;
    }

    public void showRecommendations() {
        System.out.println(recommendationService.getRecommendations());
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Easily swap between implementations
        RecommendationService recentlyAdded = new RecentlyAdded();
        RecommendationService trendingNow = new TrendingNow();

        RecommendationEngine engine1 = new RecommendationEngine(recentlyAdded);
        engine1.showRecommendations();

        RecommendationEngine engine2 = new RecommendationEngine(trendingNow);
        engine2.showRecommendations();
    }
}
```

### **Output:**

```
Showing Recently Added Movies...
Showing Trending Now Movies...
```

---

### ‚úÖ **How This Follows DIP**

* Both `RecommendationEngine` (high-level) and `RecentlyAdded` / `TrendingNow` (low-level) depend on the **interface `RecommendationService`** (abstraction).
* High-level module (`RecommendationEngine`) no longer depends on details ‚Äî only the abstraction.
* New strategies (like `GenreBased`) can be added without changing existing high-level code.

Would you like me to show how this same design could use **Spring Dependency Injection (with @Autowired)** to make it even cleaner?
Perfect üëå Let‚Äôs now refactor the same **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** example using **Spring Boot‚Äôs Dependency Injection** (via `@Autowired` and `@Component`).

This shows how **Spring automatically manages dependencies** ‚Äî you don‚Äôt create objects manually anymore; Spring wires them based on abstractions (interfaces).

---

## ‚úÖ **With Spring Boot ‚Äì Using Dependency Injection and DIP**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **RecommendationService Interface (Abstraction)**

```java
package com.example.demo.service;

public interface RecommendationService {
    String getRecommendations();
}
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Concrete Implementations (Low-Level Modules)**

```java
package com.example.demo.service.impl;

import com.example.demo.service.RecommendationService;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component("recentlyAddedService")
public class RecentlyAdded implements RecommendationService {
    @Override
    public String getRecommendations() {
        return "Showing Recently Added Movies...";
    }
}
```

```java
package com.example.demo.service.impl;

import com.example.demo.service.RecommendationService;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component("trendingNowService")
public class TrendingNow implements RecommendationService {
    @Override
    public String getRecommendations() {
        return "Showing Trending Now Movies...";
    }
}
```

```java
package com.example.demo.service.impl;

import com.example.demo.service.RecommendationService;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component("genreBasedService")
public class GenreBased implements RecommendationService {
    @Override
    public String getRecommendations() {
        return "Showing Genre-Based Recommendations...";
    }
}
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **High-Level Module (Depends on Abstraction)**

```java
package com.example.demo.engine;

import com.example.demo.service.RecommendationService;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Qualifier;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class RecommendationEngine {

    private final RecommendationService recommendationService;

    @Autowired
    public RecommendationEngine(@Qualifier("trendingNowService") RecommendationService recommendationService) {
        this.recommendationService = recommendationService;
    }

    public void showRecommendations() {
        System.out.println(recommendationService.getRecommendations());
    }
}
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Main Application Class**

```java
package com.example.demo;

import com.example.demo.engine.RecommendationEngine;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication implements CommandLineRunner {

    @Autowired
    private RecommendationEngine recommendationEngine;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Override
    public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
        recommendationEngine.showRecommendations();
    }
}
```

---

### üß© **How It Works**

* Spring scans and detects all `@Component` classes.
* `RecommendationEngine` depends on `RecommendationService`, not on specific classes.
* The actual implementation (`TrendingNow`, `RecentlyAdded`, etc.) is injected automatically via `@Qualifier`.
* To switch strategies, just change the `@Qualifier` value ‚Äî **no code modification in high-level modules!**

---

### ‚úÖ **Output**

```
Showing Trending Now Movies...
```

If you change the qualifier to `"genreBasedService"` in `RecommendationEngine`, the output will be:

```
Showing Genre-Based Recommendations...
```

This setup fully demonstrates **Dependency Inversion Principle + Spring Dependency Injection**, giving you **flexibility, scalability, and loose coupling**.
