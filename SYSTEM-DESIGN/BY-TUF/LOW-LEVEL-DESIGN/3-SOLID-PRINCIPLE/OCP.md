# **Open Closed Principle (OCP)**

## **Introduction**

There is a set of five principles for writing clean, scalable, maintainable object-oriented code.
These principles are known as **SOLID principles**.
The **O** in SOLID stands for **Open Closed Principle**.

---

## **Definition:**

As per OCP, **Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.**

This means that the behavior of a module can be extended without modifying its source code.
The goal is to reduce the risk of breaking existing functionality when requirements change.

---

## **Real-life Analogy**

Let's understand the application of OCP in real-life with the help of **power adapters**.
Imagine you travel from India to the UK. Your Indian charger doesn't fit into UK power sockets.
Instead of buying a new charger, you use a **travel adapter**.

* The adapter extends your existing charger's usability (now works in UK).
* You did not modify the charger itself.

Similarly, in code, **OCP encourages adding new functionality via extension**, rather than altering existing, stable code.

---

## **Real-World Example**

Let's now use **region-based tax calculation** (e.g., India, US, UK) in an **Invoicing System** to explain the Open/Closed Principle.
As an invoicing system grows, it must handle tax rules for different regions (the values might not be accurate):

* **India:** GST 18%
* **US:** Sales Tax 8%
* **UK:** VAT 12%

New regions may be added over time.

---

### ‚ùå **Bad Design - Violating OCP**

```java
public class Invoice {
    public double calculateTax(String country, double amount) {
        if (country.equalsIgnoreCase("India")) {
            return amount * 0.18;
        } else if (country.equalsIgnoreCase("US")) {
            return amount * 0.08;
        } else if (country.equalsIgnoreCase("UK")) {
            return amount * 0.12;
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
```

### üîç The above code is considered a bad practice because:

* Adding a new region (e.g., Germany) requires modifying this method.
* You risk breaking existing logic while adding new functionality.
* Hard to test, maintain, or scale.
* Violates the **Open/Closed Principle**.

---

### ‚úÖ **Good Design - Follows OCP**

```java
// 1. Define a Tax Strategy Interface
public interface TaxCalculator {
    double calculateTax(double amount);
}

// 2. Implement Region-Specific Tax Calculators
public class IndiaTaxCalculator implements TaxCalculator {
    public double calculateTax(double amount) {
        return amount * 0.18;
    }
}

public class USTaxCalculator implements TaxCalculator {
    public double calculateTax(double amount) {
        return amount * 0.08;
    }
}

public class UKTaxCalculator implements TaxCalculator {
    public double calculateTax(double amount) {
        return amount * 0.12;
    }
}

// 3. Invoice Class Using Dependency Injection
public class Invoice {
    private TaxCalculator taxCalculator;

    public Invoice(TaxCalculator taxCalculator) {
        this.taxCalculator = taxCalculator;
    }

    public double calculateFinalAmount(double amount) {
        double tax = taxCalculator.calculateTax(amount);
        return amount + tax;
    }
}

// 4. Main Program
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TaxCalculator indiaTax = new IndiaTaxCalculator();
        Invoice invoice = new Invoice(indiaTax);

        double total = invoice.calculateFinalAmount(1000);
        System.out.println("Final Amount (India): " + total);
    }
}
```

---

### üß© **Explanation**

* **Define a Tax Strategy Interface:**
  The `TaxCalculator` interface defines a contract for all region-specific tax classes to follow, enabling **polymorphism and extension**.

* **Implement Region-Specific Tax Calculators:**
  The `IndiaTaxCalculator`, `USTaxCalculator`, and `UKTaxCalculator` classes provide concrete implementations of the `TaxCalculator` interface for each region, encapsulating tax logic.

* **Using Dependency Injection:**
  The `Invoice` class is decoupled from specific tax types by receiving a `TaxCalculator` from the outside (this is called **Dependency Injection**).

* **Main Running Code:**
  In the `Main` class, we create the appropriate tax calculator and inject it into the `Invoice` class, making the system easily extensible for new regions.

---

### üí° Assume that now, we want to support Germany with 15% tax

In such a case, a simple code snippet can be introduced in the file:

```java
public class GermanyTaxCalculator implements TaxCalculator {
    public double calculateTax(double amount) {
        return amount * 0.15;
    }
}
```

‚Ä¶and just pass `new GermanyTaxCalculator()` to `Invoice`.
No modification to `Invoice` or `Main` are needed. ‚úÖ

## **When to Apply OCP**

The **Open/Closed Principle** is especially useful in the following scenarios:

* When a module is expected to change or evolve due to shifting business or technical requirements.
* When there is a need to extend functionality without modifying existing, tested code.
* When developing **frameworks, plugins, or extensible systems** such as billing engines, tax calculators, or UI components.
* When aiming to safeguard stable, production-ready modules from regression caused by direct changes.
* When a class is becoming a **God Class** ‚Äî handling too many responsibilities or branching logic ‚Äî which signals a need to extract behaviors into separate, extendable components.

That said, applying the principle **preemptively** without clear extension needs can introduce unnecessary abstraction and complexity.
It is generally most effective when applied in response to observed patterns of change or a well-understood need for scalability.

---

## **Common Misconceptions about OCP**

There are a few misconceptions that revolve around OCP. Let's talk about them one by one:

* **‚ÄúOpen/Closed means code should never be changed again.‚Äù**
  This interpretation overlooks the intent of OCP. The principle emphasizes avoiding changes to core logic while allowing behavior to be extended safely.

* **‚ÄúOCP leads to too many classes, so it's overkill.‚Äù**
  It‚Äôs true that applying OCP often results in more classes or interfaces. However, this trade-off typically improves modularity, testability, and maintainability, especially in systems expected to evolve.

* **‚ÄúOCP makes the code harder to read.‚Äù**
  In small or short-lived projects, added abstraction can feel unnecessary.
  But in systems with complex behavior or frequent changes, well-structured extensibility can actually **improve clarity** by separating concerns and reducing conditional logic.

* **‚ÄúOCP should always be applied upfront.‚Äù**
  Applying OCP preemptively can result in unnecessary abstraction and complexity.
  It is often more effective when used in response to emerging patterns of change.

* **‚ÄúRefactoring contradicts OCP.‚Äù**
  Refactoring is not a violation of OCP. On the contrary, it is frequently a step toward making code compliant with OCP by improving its structure and extensibility.

* **‚ÄúOCP makes retesting legacy code unnecessary.‚Äù**
  While the principle aims to reduce the need for modifying and retesting stable components, new extensions still require thorough testing to ensure correctness and integration.
