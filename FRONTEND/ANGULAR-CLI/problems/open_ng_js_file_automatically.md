Thanks for sharing the screenshot â€” I see whatâ€™s happening ðŸ‘€.

When you type `ng version`, instead of running Angular CLI, your system is opening the `ng.js` file in **VS Code**.
This happens because **Windows file associations or PATH are misconfigured**. Basically, Windows thinks `ng` is a JavaScript file, so it opens it in VS Code instead of executing it with Node.js.

### ðŸ”§ Fix: Run Angular CLI Properly

#### 1. Check if Angular CLI is installed globally

Run in **cmd**:

```bash
npm list -g --depth=0
```

You should see `@angular/cli` in the list.

If not, install it:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

---

#### 2. Ensure `ng` runs as a command (not opens in VS Code)

On Windows:

1. Press **Win + R**, type:

   ```
   sysdm.cpl
   ```

   â†’ Go to **Advanced â†’ Environment Variables**.
2. In **System variables**, find `Path`.
3. Make sure these folders exist in your PATH (adjust `USERNAME` accordingly):

   ```
   C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\npm
   ```

   This is where `ng.cmd` (the actual CLI runner) is installed.
4. If itâ€™s missing, add it and **restart CMD**.

---

#### 3. Clear wrong file association

Sometimes `.js` files are associated with VS Code directly, so when `ng` calls `ng.js`, Windows opens it in VS Code.

Run this in cmd (to reset JS execution to Node):

```bash
assoc .js=jsfile
ftype jsfile="C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe" "%1" %*
```

(Adjust the path to `node.exe` if your Node.js is installed elsewhere.)

---

#### 4. Test

Now close CMD, open a **new one**, and run:

```bash
ng version
```

It should execute Angular CLI instead of opening VS Code.
